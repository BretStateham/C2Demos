  •  Duplicate mouth, fill red move down 2-3 times (down arrow key)
    •  duplicate original mouth
    •  select duplicated mouth and red mouth
    •  "Path" | "Intersection"
  •  Make construction Hat:
    •  Draw an ellipse for the hat brim
    •  Rotate / scale / position properly
    •  Fill yellow (#FFCC00 ish)
    •  Duplicate to make dome of hat 
    •  Rotate / scale / position / distort properly
    •  Group hat dome and brim together 
    •  show that the group can be manipulated as a unit
    •  Drag the hat off the head so we can make hair
  •  Use the Path tool to make some hair
    •  Use the bezier tool
    •  Create jaggy shape using straight lines
    •  Inlude an area for the ear
    •  Use the node tool
    •  Select all nodes
    •  From the toolbar use the "Make selected nodes smooth" tool (second node shaping icon)
    •  Use eyedropper tool to make hair same color as eyebrows
  •  Try positioning the hat back over the hair
    •  Show that it is "behind" the hair
    •  Use the forward / backwards / move to front / move to back buttons to change z-order.
  •  At this point, we should have a pretty complete hat
  •  Add some detail to the hat
    •  Ungroup the hat
    •  Use the bezier tool to create a triangle shape
    •  Use the node tool, click on a segment, not a node, drag to make curve
    •  curve sides of triangle
    •  eyedropper to hat color
    •  Use the "Fill and Stroke" to darken

    •  Regroup hat dome, brim, and triangles
  •  Use the gradient tool to give the nose a pink tip
  •  Let's call the head done.  Group the entire head into a single object.
  •  Create a rectangle for the neck
    •  No stroke
    •  Same fill color as face (eyedropper)
    •  Darken fill so it is a little "tanner" than the face
    •  There's your neck!
  •  Create another rectangle for the body
    •  Fill it with an olive green color
    •  Grab the node tool
    •  Notice that the top right node is a circle
    •  drag it to create a rounded corner
    •  Notice there is another circle for the other edge
    •  You can drag the circles individually or 
       Use the Ctrl key to drag both the same
    •  Convert it to a path "Path" | "Object to path"
    •  Start to deform it into an upper torso
    •  Give our construction worker a beer gut and a big butt!
  •  Ok, so, we get the idea.  To create a character:
    •  Use primitive shapes like circles, ellipses, rectangles
    •  Distort / scale / rototate to look the way you want
    •  Boolean operations (Intersection, Union, etc.) are a great way to make complex shapes    
    •  When necessary, use the bezier tool to creat your own shapes
    •  Multiple shapes can be "grouped together"
    •  You can position shapes "infront" or "behind" other shapes

//// ===========================================================================
//// Use my Character Template
//// ===========================================================================

  •  I've created a template file for InkScape
    •  Use it to kick-start your character development
    •  Includes all the primivtive shapes for the major body parts
    •  Includes a "wireframe" layer to show original shapes
  •  Open "Demos\Assets\Templates\Character Template.svg"
  •  Once you open it, save it: "Demos\Before\Construction Worker\Character\Construction Worker.svg"
  •  Review the contents of the file
    •  Open the layers window ("Layer" | "Layers...")
    •  Show the four layers
      •  Character: Unlocked. Contains shapes for you to modify
      •  Wireframe: Locked. Contains original shapes, opacity at 25%
      •  Bounding Box: Locked. Contains 512x512 transparent box.
                       This gives you a convenient shape to select for export
      •  Notes:     Unlocked: Contains instructions
  • Show that you can lock/unlock layers 
  • Show that you can hide/show layers
  • Show that you can re-order, etc. layers.
